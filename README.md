## SAPUI5 Walkthrough

### SAPUI5 Documentation Walkthrough

#### Description from SAP:
"We first introduce you to the basic development paradigms like Model-View-Controller and establish a best-practice structure of our application. We'll do this along the classic example of “Hello World” and start a new app from scratch. Next, we'll introduce the fundamental data binding concepts of SAPUI5 and extend our app to show a list of invoices. We'll continue to add more functionality by adding navigation, extending controls, and making our app responsive.Finally we'll look at the testing features and the built-in support tools of SAPUI5."
